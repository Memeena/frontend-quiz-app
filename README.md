## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Used useReducer hook for the first time and learnt how to consolidate the logic of the code in a single place.
- Switched between dark/light theme and made changes to CSS through "data" attribute.
- Reused "ChoosenHeading" component,"Button" component whenever needed throughout the code.
- Used "React Component" for using SVG elements in the code.

### Continued development

- Planning to develop the code further by using useContext hook.
- Shall implement timer functionality.
- Shall implement "high score" functionality.
